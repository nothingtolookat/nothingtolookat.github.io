<h1><a id="Hi_Im_Dan_fucking_Starner_0"></a>Hi. I’m Dan <em>fucking</em> Starner.</h1>
<p><em>(Wow, I don’t promote this site, so since you found it, congrats! You found the <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/readyplayerone-easteregg-final.jpg">Easter Egg</a>)</em></p>
<p>I don’t need any fancy websites that have millions of animations and cool pictures. All I need is your attention.</p>
<p>I’m a Software Engineer who <strong>makes things work fast</strong>. They might not look pretty to your eyes, but like this website, they <em>are fast as fuck</em>.</p>

<li><strong>ACV Auctions</strong>: I wrote a pretty fucking cool Notification Service and Media Serving Service.
<ul>
<li>The former handled millions of notifications a month and reduced our 3rd party message costs by <strong>only</strong> a few hundred fucking percent. Pretty cool, right?</li>
<li>The latter allowed for resizing and serving of media that is used all throughout the company’s websites…Its not serving <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/catpics/">shitty Reddit cat pics</a>, but still pretty awesome.</li>
</ul>
